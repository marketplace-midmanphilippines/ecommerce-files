It can be used for a variety of foods, including game, pork chops, sausages, pork or mixed kebabs, and Roman-style gnocchi.</p><p></p><p><strong>Grill Cooking with a Closed Door</strong></p><p>Recommended for quick and deep grilling, browning, and roasting meat in general, fillet, Florentine steak, fish, and even vegetables.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking from Above</strong></p><p>It is especially good for browning and adding the last bit of color to many foods; it is the recommended function for burgers, pork chops, veal steaks, sole, cuttlefish, etc.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Moisture from Above</strong></p><p>Ideal for browning and giving many foods a final pop of color without sacrificing their tenderness.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking from the Ground Up</strong></p><p>Pastries (biscuits, meringues, leavened desserts, fruit desserts, etc.) are best cooked using this technique to finish the cooking cycle.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking Moist from Below</strong></p><p>This is the best cooking technique for finishing the cooking cycle while keeping the proper moisture content.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking Static Normal</strong></p><p>Pork chops, sausages, salt cod, braised meat, game, roast veal, meringues and biscuits, baked fruit, etc. can all be cooked in this traditional electric oven function.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Moist Static</strong></p><p>This increases the moisture content of typical static cooking.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Several Fans</strong></p><p>This feature enables cooking multiple dishes at once without the smells blending. Lasagna, croissants and brioches, tarts, cakes, etc. can be baked, saving time and electricity.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Several Moist Fans</strong></p><p>Multiple-fan cooking gains more moisture as a result.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking ECO</strong></p><p>This feature enables you to cook while using much less electricity. Braised meats, white meats, baked pasta, and delicate pastries are just a few examples of foods that benefit from slow roasting when using the ECO function.

You can produce a soft and juicy roast or a crispy baked dish in this manner.</p><p></p><p><strong>Temperature ranging from 85\\u00b0 to 575\\u00b0 F</strong></p><p>ILVE ovens make it simple to prepare intricate and sophisticated recipes with flawless results, from proofing to cooking, roasting to low temperature.</p><p></p><p><strong>High Density Insulation and Ventilation for Tangential Cooling</strong></p><p>prevents the kitchen and the furniture near the oven from getting too hot.</p><p></p><p><strong>For Complete Cleaning, Fold the Grill Coil</strong></p><p>The electric heating element of the grill can be lowered to more easily clean the upper portion of the cavity thanks to the articulated support.</p><p></p><p><strong>Easy Enamel Cleaning</strong></p><p>Grease can be cleaned more easily because it does not adhere to the surface.</p><p></p><p><strong>Functions of a Primary Oven 60 E3 TFT S UOV</strong></p><p></p><ul><li>Pizza service</li><li>Defrosting</li><li>Cooking intensively</li><li>Quick start</li><li>Cooking with lots of moisture</li><li>Cooking on a fan grill</li><li>Grill cooking with a closed door</li><li>Cooking from above</li><li>Cooking that is moist from above</li><li>Cooking from below</li><li>Cooking that is moist from below</li><li>Normal cooking that is static</li><li>Cooking that is moist and static</li><li>multiple fans cooking</li><li>multiple moist fans cooking</li><li>cooking ECO</li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Functions of the Secondary Oven UOV 30 E3 TFT</strong></p><p></p><ul><li>Grill cooking with a closed door</li><li>Cooking from above</li><li>Cooking from below</li><li>Normal cooking that is static</li><li>cooking ECO</li></ul><hr/><p></p><p><strong>Pizza Party</strong></p><p>Suitable for baking pizza, as well as bread and focaccia The lower heating element serves as the primary heat source and, along with the other underpowered heating elements, produces the ideal environment for this kind of cooking.</p><p></p><p><strong>Defrosting</strong></p><p>Assures that all frozen food is quickly defrosted and brought to room temperature without losing its flavor or appearance.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking Intensive</strong></p><p>With steam discharge, it guarantees quick and thorough cooking. Baked potatoes and vegetables, chicken, salt-crusted fish, etc. are advised for a crispy outcome.</p><p></p><p><strong>Quick Start</strong></p><p>With the quick preheating function, you can quickly reach your desired temperature before selecting the cooking mode that best suits your dish. When set to a low temperature, it also functions as a quick defrosting device.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Moisture</strong></p><p>The steam block ensures rapid and thorough cooking. It is advised for moist cooking, such as chicken cacciatore, braised meat, stewed rabbit, salt cod, etc.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking on a Fan Grill</strong></p><p>This function is especially quick and deep, and it saves a lot of energy. It can be used for a variety of foods, including game, pork chops, sausages, pork or mixed kebabs, and Roman-style gnocchi.</p><p></p><p><strong>Grill Cooking with a Closed Door</strong></p><p>Recommended for quick and deep grilling, browning, and roasting meat in general, fillet, Florentine steak, fish, and even vegetables.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking from Above</strong></p><p>It is especially good for browning and adding the last bit of color to many foods; it is the recommended function for burgers, pork chops, veal steaks, sole, cuttlefish, etc.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Moisture from Above</strong></p><p>Ideal for browning and giving many foods a final pop of color without sacrificing their tenderness.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking from the Ground Up</strong></p><p>Pastries (biscuits, meringues, leavened desserts, fruit desserts, etc.) are best cooked using this technique to finish the cooking cycle.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking Moist from Below</strong></p><p>This is the best cooking technique for finishing the cooking cycle while keeping the proper moisture content.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking Static Normal</strong></p><p>Pork chops, sausages, salt cod, braised meat, game, roast veal, meringues and biscuits, baked fruit, etc. can all be cooked in this traditional electric oven function.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Moist Static</strong></p><p>This increases the moisture content of typical static cooking.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Several Fans</strong></p><p>This feature enables cooking multiple dishes at once without the smells blending. Lasagna, croissants and brioches, tarts, cakes, etc. can be baked, saving time and electricity.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Several Moist Fans</strong></p><p>Multiple-fan cooking gains more moisture as a result.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking ECO</strong></p><p>This feature enables you to cook while using much less electricity. Braised meats, white meats, baked pasta, and delicate pastries are just a few examples of foods that benefit from slow roasting when using the ECO function. For frozen foods, this cooking cycle is not advised.</p><p></p><p><strong>Proposition 65 in California</strong></p><p>WARNING: Cancer and Reproductive Harm</p><p><a href=\\\"/cdn/shop/files/.\\\"

It is advised for moist cooking, such as chicken cacciatore, braised meat, stewed rabbit, salt cod, etc.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking on a Fan Grill</strong></p><p>This function is especially quick and deep, and it saves a lot of energy. It can be used for a variety of foods, including game, pork chops, sausages, pork or mixed kebabs, and Roman-style gnocchi.</p><p></p><p><strong>Grill Cooking with a Closed Door</strong></p><p>Recommended for quick and deep grilling, browning, and roasting meat in general, fillet, Florentine steak, fish, and even vegetables.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking from Above</strong></p><p>It is especially good for browning and adding the last bit of color to many foods; it is the recommended function for burgers, pork chops, veal steaks, sole, cuttlefish, etc.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Moisture from Above</strong></p><p>Ideal for browning and giving many foods a final pop of color without sacrificing their tenderness.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking from the Ground Up</strong></p><p>Pastries (biscuits, meringues, leavened desserts, fruit desserts, etc.) are best cooked using this technique to finish the cooking cycle.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking Moist from Below</strong></p><p>This is the best cooking technique for finishing the cooking cycle while keeping the proper moisture content.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking Static Normal</strong></p><p>Pork chops, sausages, salt cod, braised meat, game, roast veal, meringues and biscuits, baked fruit, etc. can all be cooked in this traditional electric oven function.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Moist Static</strong></p><p>This increases the moisture content of typical static cooking.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Several Fans</strong></p><p>This feature enables cooking multiple dishes at once without the smells blending. Lasagna, croissants and brioches, tarts, cakes, etc. can be baked, saving time and electricity.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Several Moist Fans</strong></p><p>Multiple-fan cooking gains more moisture as a result.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking ECO</strong></p><p>This feature enables you to cook while using much less electricity. Braised meats, white meats, baked pasta, and delicate pastries are just a few examples of foods that benefit from slow roasting when using the ECO function. For frozen foods, this cooking cycle is not advised.</p><p></p><p><strong>Proposition 65 in California</strong></p><p>WARNING: Cancer and Reproductive Harm</p><p><a href=\\\"/cdn/shop/files/.\\\"

You can produce a soft and juicy roast or a crispy baked dish in this manner.</p><p></p><p><strong>Temperature ranging from 85\\u00b0 to 575\\u00b0 F</strong></p><p>ILVE ovens make it simple to prepare intricate and sophisticated recipes with flawless results, from proofing to cooking, roasting to low temperature.</p><p></p><p><strong>High Density Insulation and Ventilation for Tangential Cooling</strong></p><p>prevents the kitchen and the furniture near the oven from getting too hot.</p><p></p><p><strong>For Complete Cleaning, Fold the Grill Coil</strong></p><p>The electric heating element of the grill can be lowered to more easily clean the upper portion of the cavity thanks to the articulated support.</p><p></p><p><strong>Easy Enamel Cleaning</strong></p><p>Grease can be cleaned more easily because it does not adhere to the surface.</p><p></p><p><strong>Functions of a Primary Oven 60 E3 TFT S UOV</strong></p><p></p><ul><li>Pizza service</li><li>Defrosting</li><li>Cooking intensively</li><li>Quick start</li><li>Cooking with lots of moisture</li><li>Cooking on a fan grill</li><li>Grill cooking with a closed door</li><li>Cooking from above</li><li>Cooking that is moist from above</li><li>Cooking from below</li><li>Cooking that is moist from below</li><li>Normal cooking that is static</li><li>Cooking that is moist and static</li><li>multiple fans cooking</li><li>multiple moist fans cooking</li><li>cooking ECO</li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Functions of the Secondary Oven UOV 30 E3 TFT</strong></p><p></p><ul><li>Grill cooking with a closed door</li><li>Cooking from above</li><li>Cooking from below</li><li>Normal cooking that is static</li><li>cooking ECO</li></ul><hr/><p></p><p><strong>Pizza Party</strong></p><p>Suitable for baking pizza, as well as bread and focaccia The lower heating element serves as the primary heat source and, along with the other underpowered heating elements, produces the ideal environment for this kind of cooking.</p><p></p><p><strong>Defrosting</strong></p><p>Assures that all frozen food is quickly defrosted and brought to room temperature without losing its flavor or appearance.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking Intensive</strong></p><p>With steam discharge, it guarantees quick and thorough cooking. Baked potatoes and vegetables, chicken, salt-crusted fish, etc. are advised for a crispy outcome.</p><p></p><p><strong>Quick Start</strong></p><p>With the quick preheating function, you can quickly reach your desired temperature before selecting the cooking mode that best suits your dish. When set to a low temperature, it also functions as a quick defrosting device.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Moisture</strong></p><p>The steam block ensures rapid and thorough cooking. It is advised for moist cooking, such as chicken cacciatore, braised meat, stewed rabbit, salt cod, etc.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking on a Fan Grill</strong></p><p>This function is especially quick and deep, and it saves a lot of energy. It can be used for a variety of foods, including game, pork chops, sausages, pork or mixed kebabs, and Roman-style gnocchi.</p><p></p><p><strong>Grill Cooking with a Closed Door</strong></p><p>Recommended for quick and deep grilling, browning, and roasting meat in general, fillet, Florentine steak, fish, and even vegetables.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking from Above</strong></p><p>It is especially good for browning and adding the last bit of color to many foods; it is the recommended function for burgers, pork chops, veal steaks, sole, cuttlefish, etc.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Moisture from Above</strong></p><p>Ideal for browning and giving many foods a final pop of color without sacrificing their tenderness.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking from the Ground Up</strong></p><p>Pastries (biscuits, meringues, leavened desserts, fruit desserts, etc.) are best cooked using this technique to finish the cooking cycle.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking Moist from Below</strong></p><p>This is the best cooking technique for finishing the cooking cycle while keeping the proper moisture content.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking Static Normal</strong></p><p>Pork chops, sausages, salt cod, braised meat, game, roast veal, meringues and biscuits, baked fruit, etc. can all be cooked in this traditional electric oven function.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Moist Static</strong></p><p>This increases the moisture content of typical static cooking.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Several Fans</strong></p><p>This feature enables cooking multiple dishes at once without the smells blending. Lasagna, croissants and brioches, tarts, cakes, etc. can be baked, saving time and electricity.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Several Moist Fans</strong></p><p>Multiple-fan cooking gains more moisture as a result.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking ECO</strong></p><p>This feature enables you to cook while using much less electricity. Braised meats, white meats, baked pasta, and delicate pastries are just a few examples of foods that benefit from slow roasting when using the ECO function. For frozen foods, this cooking cycle is not advised.</p><p></p><p><strong>Proposition 65 in California</strong></p><p>WARNING: Cancer and Reproductive Harm</p><p><a href=\\\"/cdn/shop/files/.\\\"

You can produce a soft and juicy roast or a crispy baked dish in this manner.</p><p></p><p><strong>Temperature ranging from 85\\u00b0 to 575\\u00b0 F</strong></p><p>ILVE ovens make it simple to prepare intricate and sophisticated recipes with flawless results, from proofing to cooking, roasting to low temperature.</p><p></p><p><strong>High Density Insulation and Ventilation for Tangential Cooling</strong></p><p>prevents the kitchen and the furniture near the oven from getting too hot.</p><p></p><p><strong>For Complete Cleaning, Fold the Grill Coil</strong></p><p>The electric heating element of the grill can be lowered to more easily clean the upper portion of the cavity thanks to the articulated support.</p><p></p><p><strong>Easy Enamel Cleaning</strong></p><p>Grease can be cleaned more easily because it does not adhere to the surface.</p><p></p><p><strong>Functions of a Primary Oven 60 E3 TFT S UOV</strong></p><p></p><ul><li>Pizza service</li><li>Defrosting</li><li>Cooking intensively</li><li>Quick start</li><li>Cooking with lots of moisture</li><li>Cooking on a fan grill</li><li>Grill cooking with a closed door</li><li>Cooking from above</li><li>Cooking that is moist from above</li><li>Cooking from below</li><li>Cooking that is moist from below</li><li>Normal cooking that is static</li><li>Cooking that is moist and static</li><li>multiple fans cooking</li><li>multiple moist fans cooking</li><li>cooking ECO</li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Functions of the Secondary Oven UOV 30 E3 TFT</strong></p><p></p><ul><li>Grill cooking with a closed door</li><li>Cooking from above</li><li>Cooking from below</li><li>Normal cooking that is static</li><li>cooking ECO</li></ul><hr/><p></p><p><strong>Pizza Party</strong></p><p>Suitable for baking pizza, as well as bread and focaccia The lower heating element serves as the primary heat source and, along with the other underpowered heating elements, produces the ideal environment for this kind of cooking.</p><p></p><p><strong>Defrosting</strong></p><p>Assures that all frozen food is quickly defrosted and brought to room temperature without losing its flavor or appearance.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking Intensive</strong></p><p>With steam discharge, it guarantees quick and thorough cooking. Baked potatoes and vegetables, chicken, salt-crusted fish, etc. are advised for a crispy outcome.</p><p></p><p><strong>Quick Start</strong></p><p>With the quick preheating function, you can quickly reach your desired temperature before selecting the cooking mode that best suits your dish. When set to a low temperature, it also functions as a quick defrosting device.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Moisture</strong></p><p>The steam block ensures rapid and thorough cooking. It is advised for moist cooking, such as chicken cacciatore, braised meat, stewed rabbit, salt cod, etc.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking on a Fan Grill</strong></p><p>This function is especially quick and deep, and it saves a lot of energy. It can be used for a variety of foods, including game, pork chops, sausages, pork or mixed kebabs, and Roman-style gnocchi.</p><p></p><p><strong>Grill Cooking with a Closed Door</strong></p><p>Recommended for quick and deep grilling, browning, and roasting meat in general, fillet, Florentine steak, fish, and even vegetables.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking from Above</strong></p><p>It is especially good for browning and adding the last bit of color to many foods; it is the recommended function for burgers, pork chops, veal steaks, sole, cuttlefish, etc.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Moisture from Above</strong></p><p>Ideal for browning and giving many foods a final pop of color without sacrificing their tenderness.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking from the Ground Up</strong></p><p>Pastries (biscuits, meringues, leavened desserts, fruit desserts, etc.) are best cooked using this technique to finish the cooking cycle.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking Moist from Below</strong></p><p>This is the best cooking technique for finishing the cooking cycle while keeping the proper moisture content.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking Static Normal</strong></p><p>Pork chops, sausages, salt cod, braised meat, game, roast veal, meringues and biscuits, baked fruit, etc. can all be cooked in this traditional electric oven function.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Moist Static</strong></p><p>This increases the moisture content of typical static cooking.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Several Fans</strong></p><p>This feature enables cooking multiple dishes at once without the smells blending. Lasagna, croissants and brioches, tarts, cakes, etc. can be baked, saving time and electricity.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Several Moist Fans</strong></p><p>Multiple-fan cooking gains more moisture as a result.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking ECO</strong></p><p>This feature enables you to cook while using much less electricity. Braised meats, white meats, baked pasta, and delicate pastries are just a few examples of foods that benefit from slow roasting when using the ECO function. For frozen foods, this cooking cycle is not advised.</p><p></p><p><strong>Proposition 65 in California</strong></p><p>WARNING: Cancer and Reproductive Harm</p><p><a href=\\\"/cdn/shop/files/.\\\"

It is advised for moist cooking, such as chicken cacciatore, braised meat, stewed rabbit, salt cod, etc.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking on a Fan Grill</strong></p><p>This function is especially quick and deep, and it saves a lot of energy. It can be used for a variety of foods, including game, pork chops, sausages, pork or mixed kebabs, and Roman-style gnocchi.</p><p></p><p><strong>Grill Cooking with a Closed Door</strong></p><p>Recommended for quick and deep grilling, browning, and roasting meat in general, fillet, Florentine steak, fish, and even vegetables.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking from Above</strong></p><p>It is especially good for browning and adding the last bit of color to many foods; it is the recommended function for burgers, pork chops, veal steaks, sole, cuttlefish, etc.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Moisture from Above</strong></p><p>Ideal for browning and giving many foods a final pop of color without sacrificing their tenderness.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking from the Ground Up</strong></p><p>Pastries (biscuits, meringues, leavened desserts, fruit desserts, etc.) are best cooked using this technique to finish the cooking cycle.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking Moist from Below</strong></p><p>This is the best cooking technique for finishing the cooking cycle while keeping the proper moisture content.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking Static Normal</strong></p><p>Pork chops, sausages, salt cod, braised meat, game, roast veal, meringues and biscuits, baked fruit, etc. can all be cooked in this traditional electric oven function.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Moist Static</strong></p><p>This increases the moisture content of typical static cooking.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Several Fans</strong></p><p>This feature enables cooking multiple dishes at once without the smells blending. Lasagna, croissants and brioches, tarts, cakes, etc. can be baked, saving time and electricity.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking with Several Moist Fans</strong></p><p>Multiple-fan cooking gains more moisture as a result.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cooking ECO</strong></p><p>This feature enables you to cook while using much less electricity. Braised meats, white meats, baked pasta, and delicate pastries are just a few examples of foods that benefit from slow roasting when using the ECO function. For frozen foods, this cooking cycle is not advised.</p><p></p><p><strong>Proposition 65 in California</strong></p><p>WARNING: Cancer and Reproductive Harm</p><p><a href=\\\"/cdn/shop/files/.\\\"

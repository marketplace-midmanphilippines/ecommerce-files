The High Noon Outdoor Kitchen Island features 4 easy-to-assemble modules of Urban Bonfire's functional and stylish cabinetry, constructed from the finest quality materials. Its secure, ample storage is enough to suit any high-performing host, and the built-in Blaze grill offers a complementary premium experience, perfect for any yard. </p><p>As it's powered by a Blaze LTE+ gas grill, the High Noon Outdoor Kitchen Island is already a class above other modular islands. But where it really impresses is in its construction: noncombustible, thick gauge marine grade aluminum with 304 stainless steel hardware and super durable NACRA\\u0112\\u2122 powder coated finish inside and out. To add even more value, this island features a premium Dekton\\u00ae countertop and components include 3 top drawers, a pull-out trash and recycling drawer (with bins included), 2 single cabinets, and a double-door cabinet with under-grill access. </p> <p><b>Dimensions:</b> 113 1/2 inches wide, 36 and 1/2 inches high, 29 and 3/4 inches deep. <em>Note: if your island isn't going to be against a wall, you will need back panels (available separately).</em></p> <p><strong>The Blaze LTE+ Marine Grade 4-Burner Natural Gas Grill \\u2014 Ideal for Coastal Areas</strong></p> <p>The Blaze LTE+ Marine Grade Natural Gas Grill is built with coastal-climate-safe 316L stainless steel construction, designed to meet the challenges of saltwater environments head-on by resisting corrosion caused by coastal air. Equipped with four commercial grade cast stainless steel burners, each providing 14,000 BTUs, this grill delivers 56,000 BTUs across the entire cooking surface, excluding the rear burner. The 10,000 BTU infrared burner is the perfect companion for the optional rotisserie kit to give you extra versatility in your grilling menu. The durable triangle-style stainless steel cooking rods give your food an all-over sear on the 715 square inch cooking space. Your grill will reliably start every time with the push-and-turn flame-thrower ignition. </p> <p>The removable warming rack is a handy place to keep food warm while you grill, and the stainless steel heat zone separators give you different cooking zones on the grilling surface. This creates separate zones so you can cook at different temperatures and different styles at the same time. Flame tamers reduce flare-ups, and the full-width drip tray makes cleanup simple. New interior halogen grill lights shine on the cooking surface while the hood is open, and the illuminated control knobs change colors when gas is flowing so you can see when your burners are on and when they are engaged. The double-lined stainless steel grill hood prevents heat discoloration and even includes a hood-assist mechanism to make opening and closing your lid easier than ever. </p> <p><strong>Solid, Easy-to-Assemble Cabinet Modules are Marine-Grade Aluminum with a NACRA\\u0112 finish </strong></p> <p>For cabinetry that will enhance your outdoor kitchen experience, look no further. Urban Bonfire modules are designed to withstand even the harshest outdoor conditions with marine-grade aluminum that has a NACRA\\u0112 powder-coated finish. NACRA\\u0112 is an antimicrobial product made from FDA-approved, environmentally sustainable materials and features a durable all-season formulation that resists fading, stains, and scratches. </p> <p>These cabinets are as tough as they are functional. The outdoor rated 304 stainless steel hardware will last a lifetime, while the removable panels allow easy access to plumbing and electrical connections, making installation and maintenance a breeze. The commercial-grade stainless steel leveling legs and self-leveling toe kick adapt to slope and site conditions, ensuring a stable and secure installation on any surface. Each outdoor kitchen design includes drawers, a trash/recycling bin, and plenty of cabinet storage space to fit all your cooking tools and accessories. Their sleek design and practical features make these cabinets the perfect addition to any outdoor kitchen setup. </p><p><strong>The Blaze x Urban Bonfire Outdoor Kitchen Island is finished in Architectural Bronze</strong>, a rich brown tone that gives your backyard a warm and inviting ambiance that will never go out of style. This finish not only adds a touch of timeless elegance but also complements the natural elements of your outdoor space, giving it a cozy and down-to-earth feel. </p><p><strong>Easy-to-Maintain Premium Dekton Keon Countertop for Prep and Staging </strong></p> <p>The Blaze outdoor kitchen island is topped with the sleek sophistication of a Keon Premium Dekton countertop.

Its secure, ample storage is enough to suit any high-performing host, and the built-in Blaze grill offers a complementary premium experience, perfect for any yard. </p><p>As it's powered by a Blaze LTE+ gas grill, the High Noon Outdoor Kitchen Island is already a class above other modular islands. But where it really impresses is in its construction: noncombustible, thick gauge marine grade aluminum with 304 stainless steel hardware and super durable NACRA\\u0112\\u2122 powder coated finish inside and out. To add even more value, this island features a premium Dekton\\u00ae countertop and components include 3 top drawers, a pull-out trash and recycling drawer (with bins included), 2 single cabinets, and a double-door cabinet with under-grill access. </p> <p><b>Dimensions:</b> 113 1/2 inches wide, 36 and 1/2 inches high, 29 and 3/4 inches deep. <em>Note: if your island isn't going to be against a wall, you will need back panels (available separately).</em></p> <p><strong>The Blaze LTE+ Marine Grade 4-Burner Natural Gas Grill \\u2014 Ideal for Coastal Areas</strong></p> <p>The Blaze LTE+ Marine Grade Natural Gas Grill is built with coastal-climate-safe 316L stainless steel construction, designed to meet the challenges of saltwater environments head-on by resisting corrosion caused by coastal air. Equipped with four commercial grade cast stainless steel burners, each providing 14,000 BTUs, this grill delivers 56,000 BTUs across the entire cooking surface, excluding the rear burner. The 10,000 BTU infrared burner is the perfect companion for the optional rotisserie kit to give you extra versatility in your grilling menu. The durable triangle-style stainless steel cooking rods give your food an all-over sear on the 715 square inch cooking space. Your grill will reliably start every time with the push-and-turn flame-thrower ignition. </p> <p>The removable warming rack is a handy place to keep food warm while you grill, and the stainless steel heat zone separators give you different cooking zones on the grilling surface. This creates separate zones so you can cook at different temperatures and different styles at the same time. Flame tamers reduce flare-ups, and the full-width drip tray makes cleanup simple. New interior halogen grill lights shine on the cooking surface while the hood is open, and the illuminated control knobs change colors when gas is flowing so you can see when your burners are on and when they are engaged.

But where it really impresses is in its construction: noncombustible, thick gauge marine grade aluminum with 304 stainless steel hardware and super durable NACRA\\u0112\\u2122 powder coated finish inside and out. To add even more value, this island features a premium Dekton\\u00ae countertop and components include 3 top drawers, a pull-out trash and recycling drawer (with bins included), 2 single cabinets, and a double-door cabinet with under-grill access. </p> <p><b>Dimensions:</b> 113 1/2 inches wide, 36 and 1/2 inches high, 29 and 3/4 inches deep. <em>Note: if your island isn't going to be against a wall, you will need back panels (available separately).</em></p> <p><strong>The Blaze LTE+ Marine Grade 4-Burner Propane Grill \\u2014 Ideal for Coastal Areas</strong></p> <p>The Blaze LTE+ Marine Grade Propane Grill is built with coastal-climate-safe 316L stainless steel construction, designed to meet the challenges of saltwater environments head-on by resisting corrosion caused by coastal air.

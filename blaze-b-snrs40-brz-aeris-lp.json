This prefabricated luxury outdoor kitchen island blends superior grilling with sophisticated style. Comprised of 3 modules, the easy-to-assemble Sunrise Outdoor Kitchen Island is built with Urban Bonfire's highest-quality materials to match the premium durability and performance of Blaze's bestselling grills. The island's efficient design and essential features make it a must-have for any outdoor chef looking to invest in their craft with only the best tools.<p> <p>The Sunrise Outdoor Kitchen Island is powered by a Blaze LTE+ gas grill. This island's immense value lies in its remarkable construction: noncombustible, thick gauge marine grade aluminum with 304 stainless steel hardware and a super durable NACRA\\u0112\\u2122 powder coated finish inside and out. Unlike other modular kitchen islands, this one won't wear quickly and will look and function flawlessly for years. It features a countertop made of premium Dekton\\u00ae, and the components include 2 top drawers, a pull-out trash and recycling bin (with bins included), a single cabinet, and a double-door cabinet with under-grill access.</p> <p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 96 1/2 inches wide, 36 1/2 inches high, 29 3/4 inches deep.<em> Note: if your island isn't going to be against a wall, you will need back panels (available separately).</em> </p> <p><strong>Reward Your Inner Grill Master with the Blaze LTE+ 5-Burner Propane Grill</strong></p> <p>The 40-Inch Blaze LTE+ Propane Grill is the perfect addition to any outdoor kitchen, featuring commercial-grade stainless steel for extra durability to last a lifetime in any backyard. The double-lined hood keeps heat inside the grill where you need it most and prevents discoloration. The LTE+ model also includes a hood assist mechanism for easy opening plus interior and exterior lighting. White interior halogen lights illuminate the cooking area while the hood is open for easy visibility at night. The LED-illuminated control system features safety glow lighting which shines white when your lights are turned on and changes to red when your burners are lit, and gas is flowing through your grill. The removable warming rack is perfect for toasting and keeping food warm, and for added convenience, the full-width drip tray is removable for easy cleaning. </p> <p>Designed for effortless lighting, Blaze's push-and-turn flame-thrower ignition reliably lights your grill without issue every time. Five cast stainless steel burners generate 14,000 BTUs each for an impressive total of 70,000 BTUs across the grilling surface. Add to that the rear infrared burner's 10,000 BTUs and you've got a grill that can cook anything. Patented triangle-shaped cooking rods use the flat side to soak up heat from the burners and transfer it to the pointed top of the grate where your food sits to give it a nice sear. Beneath these cooking rods sit 14-gauge stainless steel, full-width flame tamers that help control flare-ups, evenly distribute heat, and eliminate cold spots for consistent temperatures throughout the grill. </p> <p><strong>Solid, Easy-to-Assemble Cabinet Modules are Marine-Grade Aluminum with a NACRA\\u0112 finish </strong></p> <p>For cabinetry that will enhance your outdoor kitchen experience, look no further. Urban Bonfire modules are designed to withstand even the harshest outdoor conditions with marine-grade aluminum that has a NACRA\\u0112 powder-coated finish. NACRA\\u0112 is an antimicrobial product made from FDA-approved, environmentally sustainable materials and features a durable all-season formulation that resists fading, stains, and scratches. </p> <p>These cabinets are as tough as they are functional. The outdoor rated 304 stainless steel hardware will last a lifetime, while the removable panels allow easy access to plumbing and electrical connections, making installation and maintenance a breeze. The commercial-grade stainless steel leveling legs and self-leveling toe kick adapt to slope and site conditions, ensuring a stable and secure installation on any surface.

This prefabricated luxury outdoor kitchen island blends superior grilling with sophisticated style. Comprised of 3 modules, the easy-to-assemble Sunrise Outdoor Kitchen Island is built with Urban Bonfire's highest-quality materials to match the premium durability and performance of Blaze's bestselling grills. The island's efficient design and essential features make it a must-have for any outdoor chef looking to invest in their craft with only the best tools.<p> <p>The Sunrise Outdoor Kitchen Island is powered by a Blaze LTE+ gas grill. This island's immense value lies in its remarkable construction: noncombustible, thick gauge marine grade aluminum with 304 stainless steel hardware and a super durable NACRA\\u0112\\u2122 powder coated finish inside and out. Unlike other modular kitchen islands, this one won't wear quickly and will look and function flawlessly for years. It features a countertop made of premium Dekton\\u00ae, and the components include 2 top drawers, a pull-out trash and recycling bin (with bins included), a single cabinet, and a double-door cabinet with under-grill access.</p> <p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 96 1/2 inches wide, 36 1/2 inches high, 29 3/4 inches deep.<em> Note: if your island isn't going to be against a wall, you will need back panels (available separately).</em> </p> <p><strong>Reward Your Inner Grill Master with the Blaze LTE+ 5-Burner Propane Grill</strong></p> <p>The 40-Inch Blaze LTE+ Propane Grill is the perfect addition to any outdoor kitchen, featuring commercial-grade stainless steel for extra durability to last a lifetime in any backyard. The double-lined hood keeps heat inside the grill where you need it most and prevents discoloration. The LTE+ model also includes a hood assist mechanism for easy opening plus interior and exterior lighting. White interior halogen lights illuminate the cooking area while the hood is open for easy visibility at night. The LED-illuminated control system features safety glow lighting which shines white when your lights are turned on and changes to red when your burners are lit, and gas is flowing through your grill. The removable warming rack is perfect for toasting and keeping food warm, and for added convenience, the full-width drip tray is removable for easy cleaning. </p> <p>Designed for effortless lighting, Blaze's push-and-turn flame-thrower ignition reliably lights your grill without issue every time. Five cast stainless steel burners generate 14,000 BTUs each for an impressive total of 70,000 BTUs across the grilling surface. Add to that the rear infrared burner's 10,000 BTUs and you've got a grill that can cook anything. Patented triangle-shaped cooking rods use the flat side to soak up heat from the burners and transfer it to the pointed top of the grate where your food sits to give it a nice sear. Beneath these cooking rods sit 14-gauge stainless steel, full-width flame tamers that help control flare-ups, evenly distribute heat, and eliminate cold spots for consistent temperatures throughout the grill. </p> <p><strong>Solid, Easy-to-Assemble Cabinet Modules are Marine-Grade Aluminum with a NACRA\\u0112 finish </strong></p> <p>For cabinetry that will enhance your outdoor kitchen experience, look no further. Urban Bonfire modules are designed to withstand even the harshest outdoor conditions with marine-grade aluminum that has a NACRA\\u0112 powder-coated finish. NACRA\\u0112 is an antimicrobial product made from FDA-approved, environmentally sustainable materials and features a durable all-season formulation that resists fading, stains, and scratches. </p> <p>These cabinets are as tough as they are functional. The outdoor rated 304 stainless steel hardware will last a lifetime, while the removable panels allow easy access to plumbing and electrical connections, making installation and maintenance a breeze. The commercial-grade stainless steel leveling legs and self-leveling toe kick adapt to slope and site conditions, ensuring a stable and secure installation on any surface. Each outdoor kitchen design includes drawers, a trash/recycling bin, and plenty of cabinet storage space to fit all your cooking tools and accessories. Their sleek design and practical features make these cabinets the perfect addition to any outdoor kitchen setup. </p> <p><strong>The Blaze x Urban Bonfire Outdoor Kitchen Island is finished in Architectural Bronze</strong>, a rich brown tone that gives your backyard a warm and inviting ambiance that will never go out of style. This finish not only adds a touch of timeless elegance but also complements the natural elements of your outdoor space, giving it a cozy and down-to-earth feel. </p> <p><strong>Easy-to-Maintain Premium Dekton Keon Countertop for Prep and Staging </strong></p> <p>The Blaze outdoor kitchen island is topped with the sleek sophistication of a Keon Premium Dekton countertop. Designed to look like the natural beauty of real stone without imperfections, Keon offers a light and bright gray tone that adds a touch of modern elegance to any space. Its non-porous surface ensures easy cleaning and maintenance, making it a practical choice for outdoor kitchens.

Unlike other modular kitchen islands, this one won't wear quickly and will look and function flawlessly for years.

This prefabricated luxury outdoor kitchen island blends superior grilling with sophisticated style. Comprised of 3 modules, the easy-to-assemble Sunrise Outdoor Kitchen Island is built with Urban Bonfire's highest-quality materials to match the premium durability and performance of Blaze's bestselling grills. The island's efficient design and essential features make it a must-have for any outdoor chef looking to invest in their craft with only the best tools.<p> <p>The Sunrise Outdoor Kitchen Island is powered by a Blaze LTE+ gas grill. This island's immense value lies in its remarkable construction: noncombustible, thick gauge marine grade aluminum with 304 stainless steel hardware and a super durable NACRA\\u0112\\u2122 powder coated finish inside and out. Unlike other modular kitchen islands, this one won't wear quickly and will look and function flawlessly for years. It features a countertop made of premium Dekton\\u00ae, and the components include 2 top drawers, a pull-out trash and recycling bin (with bins included), a single cabinet, and a double-door cabinet with under-grill access.</p> <p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 96 1/2 inches wide, 36 1/2 inches high, 29 3/4 inches deep.<em> Note: if your island isn't going to be against a wall, you will need back panels (available separately).</em> </p> <p><strong>Reward Your Inner Grill Master with the Blaze LTE+ 5-Burner Natural Gas Grill</strong></p> <p>The 40-Inch Blaze LTE+ Natural Gas Grill is the perfect addition to any outdoor kitchen, featuring commercial-grade stainless steel for extra durability to last a lifetime in any backyard. The double-lined hood keeps heat inside the grill where you need it most and prevents discoloration. The LTE+ model also includes a hood assist mechanism for easy opening plus interior and exterior lighting. White interior halogen lights illuminate the cooking area while the hood is open for easy visibility at night. The LED-illuminated control system features safety glow lighting which shines white when your lights are turned on and changes to red when your burners are lit, and gas is flowing through your grill. The removable warming rack is perfect for toasting and keeping food warm, and for added convenience, the full-width drip tray is removable for easy cleaning. </p> <p>Designed for effortless lighting, Blaze's push-and-turn flame-thrower ignition reliably lights your grill without issue every time. Five cast stainless steel burners generate 14,000 BTUs each for an impressive total of 70,000 BTUs across the grilling surface. Add to that the rear infrared burner's 10,000 BTUs and you've got a grill that can cook anything. Patented triangle-shaped cooking rods use the flat side to soak up heat from the burners and transfer it to the pointed top of the grate where your food sits to give it a nice sear. Beneath these cooking rods sit 14-gauge stainless steel, full-width flame tamers that help control flare-ups, evenly distribute heat, and eliminate cold spots for consistent temperatures throughout the grill. </p> <p><strong>Solid, Easy-to-Assemble Cabinet Modules are Marine-Grade Aluminum with a NACRA\\u0112 finish </strong></p> <p>For cabinetry that will enhance your outdoor kitchen experience, look no further.

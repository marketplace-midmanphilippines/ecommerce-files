The island's efficient design and essential features make it a must-have for any outdoor chef looking to invest in their craft with only the best tools.<p> <p>The Sunrise Outdoor Kitchen Island is powered by a Blaze LTE+ gas grill. This island's immense value lies in its remarkable construction: noncombustible, thick gauge marine grade aluminum with 304 stainless steel hardware and a super durable NACRA\\u0112\\u2122 powder coated finish inside and out. Unlike other modular kitchen islands, this one won't wear quickly and will look and function flawlessly for years.

A rotisserie kit is also available for perfectly roasting meats to juicy perfection. </p> <p>The LTE+ also boasts optimized performance features such as a push-and-turn flame-thrower ignition that starts your grill with ease every time, stainless steel flame tamers to keep flare-ups at bay and work to vaporize food drippings into delicious smoke. Four cast stainless steel burners produce 14,000 BTUs of cooking power each for an impressive total of 56,000 BTUs. Above these burners sit patented triangle-shaped searing rods that create beautiful sear marks by transferring heat from the flat bottom of the cooking rod to the pointed top where your food sits.

This prefabricated luxury outdoor kitchen island blends superior grilling with sophisticated style. Comprised of 3 modules, the easy-to-assemble Sunrise Outdoor Kitchen Island is built with Urban Bonfire's highest-quality materials to match the premium durability and performance of Blaze's bestselling grills. The island's efficient design and essential features make it a must-have for any outdoor chef looking to invest in their craft with only the best tools.<p> <p>The Sunrise Outdoor Kitchen Island is powered by a Blaze LTE+ gas grill. This island's immense value lies in its remarkable construction: noncombustible, thick gauge marine grade aluminum with 304 stainless steel hardware and a super durable NACRA\\u0112\\u2122 powder coated finish inside and out. Unlike other modular kitchen islands, this one won't wear quickly and will look and function flawlessly for years. It features a countertop made of premium Dekton\\u00ae, and the components include 2 top drawers, a pull-out trash and recycling bin (with bins included), a single cabinet, and a double-door cabinet with under-grill access.</p> <p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 89 1/2 inches wide, 36 1/2 inches high, 29 3/4 inches deep.<em> Note: if your island isn't going to be against a wall, you will need back panels (available separately).</em> </p> <p><strong>Release Your Inner Grill Master with the Blaze LTE+ 4-Burner Propane Grill</strong></p> <p>Constructed of 304-grade stainless steel, the 32-Inch Blaze LTE+ Propane Grill offers premium features that help set it apart from its competitors and is designed to handle any challenges backyard grillers may face. It includes an infrared rear burner, a double-lined stainless steel grill hood for trapping heat and preventing discoloration, and a spring-assist hood that makes opening and closing the grill a cinch. Additionally, it features a white interior light that illuminates the cooking area while the hood is open for easy nighttime visibility and an LED-illuminated control system with safety glow lighting that shines white when your lights are on and changes to red when your burners are on, and gas is flowing through your grill. A rotisserie kit is also available for perfectly roasting meats to juicy perfection. </p> <p>The LTE+ also boasts optimized performance features such as a push-and-turn flame-thrower ignition that starts your grill with ease every time, stainless steel flame tamers to keep flare-ups at bay and work to vaporize food drippings into delicious smoke. Four cast stainless steel burners produce 14,000 BTUs of cooking power each for an impressive total of 56,000 BTUs. Above these burners sit patented triangle-shaped searing rods that create beautiful sear marks by transferring heat from the flat bottom of the cooking rod to the pointed top where your food sits. The benefits don't end there! This grill also has a removable warming rack to easily keep food warm while other things finish cooking, a full-width drip tray that is also removable for easy cleaning, and heat zone separators to give you the versatility you need to cook at different temperatures in different zones. </p><p><strong>Solid, Easy-to-Assemble Cabinet Modules are Marine-Grade Aluminum with a NACRA\\u0112 finish </strong></p> <p>For cabinetry that will enhance your outdoor kitchen experience, look no further.

This prefabricated luxury outdoor kitchen island blends superior grilling with sophisticated style. Comprised of 3 modules, the easy-to-assemble Sunrise Outdoor Kitchen Island is built with Urban Bonfire's highest-quality materials to match the premium durability and performance of Blaze's bestselling grills. The island's efficient design and essential features make it a must-have for any outdoor chef looking to invest in their craft with only the best tools.<p> <p>The Sunrise Outdoor Kitchen Island is powered by a Blaze LTE+ gas grill. This island's immense value lies in its remarkable construction: noncombustible, thick gauge marine grade aluminum with 304 stainless steel hardware and a super durable NACRA\\u0112\\u2122 powder coated finish inside and out. Unlike other modular kitchen islands, this one won't wear quickly and will look and function flawlessly for years. It features a countertop made of premium Dekton\\u00ae, and the components include 2 top drawers, a pull-out trash and recycling bin (with bins included), a single cabinet, and a double-door cabinet with under-grill access.</p> <p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 89 1/2 inches wide, 36 1/2 inches high, 29 3/4 inches deep.<em> Note: if your island isn't going to be against a wall, you will need back panels (available separately).</em> </p> <p><strong>Release Your Inner Grill Master with the Blaze LTE+ 4-Burner Natural Gas Grill</strong></p> <p>Constructed of 304-grade stainless steel, the 32-Inch Blaze LTE+ Natural Gas Grill offers premium features that help set it apart from its competitors and is designed to handle any challenges backyard grillers may face. It includes an infrared rear burner, a double-lined stainless steel grill hood for trapping heat and preventing discoloration, and a spring-assist hood that makes opening and closing the grill a cinch. Additionally, it features a white interior light that illuminates the cooking area while the hood is open for easy nighttime visibility and an LED-illuminated control system with safety glow lighting that shines white when your lights are on and changes to red when your burners are on, and gas is flowing through your grill. A rotisserie kit is also available for perfectly roasting meats to juicy perfection. </p> <p>The LTE+ also boasts optimized performance features such as a push-and-turn flame-thrower ignition that starts your grill with ease every time, stainless steel flame tamers to keep flare-ups at bay and work to vaporize food drippings into delicious smoke. Four cast stainless steel burners produce 14,000 BTUs of cooking power each for an impressive total of 56,000 BTUs. Above these burners sit patented triangle-shaped searing rods that create beautiful sear marks by transferring heat from the flat bottom of the cooking rod to the pointed top where your food sits. The benefits don't end there! This grill also has a removable warming rack to easily keep food warm while other things finish cooking, a full-width drip tray that is also removable for easy cleaning, and heat zone separators to give you the versatility you need to cook at different temperatures in different zones. </p><p><strong>Solid, Easy-to-Assemble Cabinet Modules are Marine-Grade Aluminum with a NACRA\\u0112 finish </strong></p> <p>For cabinetry that will enhance your outdoor kitchen experience, look no further.

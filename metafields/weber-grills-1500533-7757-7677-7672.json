That's 3 burners at 13,000 BTU each, for a total of 39,000 BTUs for efficient power. Flames are directed above the raised gas ports, while food debris falls below, minimizing clogging and ensuring the grill lights every time.</p><p>This innovative design not only helps maintain reliable ignition but also contributes to longer burner life and reduced maintenance over time.

Sear with confidence, knowing your food will come off the grill with a perfect finish and rich, caramelized flavor.</p><p><strong>Enhance Flavors Naturally With FLAVORIZER Bars</strong></p><p>FLAVORIZER Bars protect your Genesis E-325's burners from grease, distribute heat evenly across the grill surface, and turn drippings into flavorful smoke that enhances your food.

It's perfect for keeping cooked food at serving temperature without overcooking. The elevated position also frees up space on the main grates, giving you even more room to multitask like a real pro.</p><p><strong>Enjoy Long-Term Reliability With a 12-Year Warranty</strong></p><p>Weber backs the Genesis E-325 with a 12-year limited warranty, giving you peace of mind with every cookout.

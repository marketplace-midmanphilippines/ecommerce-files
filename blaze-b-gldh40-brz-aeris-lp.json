With the Golden Hour Outdoor Kitchen Island, you'll add Urban Bonfire's highest-quality island frame and cabinetry, paired with a premium, bestselling built-in Blaze grill\\u2014all without the time and hassle of using a contractor. That's 4 modules in total with stylish, secure drawers and cabinets, plus an outdoor refrigerator and stainless steel sink for a complete cooking experience in one easy-to-assemble purchase.</p><p>Nothing says luxury like an island built around a Blaze LTE+ gas grill. Not to be outdone, this island's construction stands alone in the market, thanks to noncombustible, thick gauge marine grade aluminum with 304 stainless steel hardware and super durable NACRA\\u0112\\u2122 powder coated finish inside and out. Talk about the quality. The Golden Hour Outdoor Kitchen Island also features a premium Dekton\\u00ae countertop, with components including a top drawer, a trash and recycling drawer (with bins included), a single cabinet with under-sink access, and a double-door cabinet with under-grill access, in addition to an outdoor refrigerator and a stainless steel sink and faucet.</p><p><b>Dimensions:</b> 120 1/2 inches wide, 36 and 1/2 inches high, 29 and 3/4 inches deep.<em>Note: if your island isn't going to be against a wall, you will need back panels (available separately).</em></p><p><strong>Reward Your Inner Grill Master with the Blaze LTE+ 5-Burner Propane Grill </strong></p> <p>The 40-Inch Blaze LTE+ Propane Grill is the perfect addition to any outdoor kitchen, featuring commercial-grade stainless steel for extra durability to last a lifetime in any backyard. The double-lined hood keeps heat inside the grill where you need it most and prevents discoloration. The LTE+ model also includes a hood assist mechanism for easy opening plus interior and exterior lighting. White interior halogen lights illuminate the cooking area while the hood is open for easy visibility at night. The LED-illuminated control system features safety glow lighting which shines white when your lights are turned on and changes to red when your burners are lit, and gas is flowing through your grill. The removable warming rack is perfect for toasting and keeping food warm, and for added convenience, the full-width drip tray is removable for easy cleaning. </p> <p>Designed for effortless lighting, Blaze's push-and-turn flame-thrower ignition reliably lights your grill without issue every time. Five cast stainless steel burners generate 14,000 BTUs each for an impressive total of 70,000 BTUs across the grilling surface. Add to that the rear infrared burner's 10,000 BTUs and you've got a grill that can cook anything. Patented triangle-shaped cooking rods use the flat side to soak up heat from the burners and transfer it to the pointed top of the grate where your food sits to give it a nice sear. Beneath these cooking rods sit 14-gauge stainless steel, full-width flame tamers that help control flare-ups, evenly distribute heat, and eliminate cold spots for consistent temperatures throughout the grill. </p><p><strong>Keep Food and Drinks Cool with a 5.5 Cubic Foot Outdoor Rated Fridge </strong></p><p>The Blaze 24-Inch 5.5 Cubic Feet Outdoor Rated Compact Refrigerator is a perfect companion to any outdoor kitchen.  Keep food cold while your grill preheats without having to go inside and keep your favorite chilled beverages within easy reach. Constructed of long-lasting 304 stainless steel, it features a locking mechanism, 3 adjustable glass shelves, and white LED-lit cabinet for easy nighttime access, so you won't have to hunt for your drinks in the dark. A digital thermostat with a temperature display is also included for precise cooling control. The spacious interior can hold up to 152 cans, making it ideal for entertaining large crowds. The fridge is also ETL certified, meaning it is safe to use in outdoor environments.</p><p><strong>Simplify Prep and Cleanup with an Outdoor Sink </strong></p><p>The Urban Bonfire Stainless Steel Sink and Faucet is a convenient bonus for any outdoor kitchen island. Constructed of 304 stainless steel, this sink is crafted to withstand the elements of any backyard for long-lasting performance you can count on. It's plumbed with hot and cold water, and will also work fine with only cold water, making it versatile for cooking, cleaning, and more, from scrubbing veggies and cleaning counters to washing hands. The sink's large basin provides plenty of space to wash dishes, prep food, or fill pots with ease. The included faucet features an attractive, sleek design and is also made from durable stainless steel to complement any outdoor kitchen aesthetic. With Urban Bonfire's commitment to quality and functionality, this sink and faucet set enhances the practicality of your outdoor kitchen.</p><p><strong>Solid, Easy-to-Assemble Cabinet Modules are Marine-Grade Aluminum with a NACRA\\u0112 finish </strong></p><p>For cabinetry that will enhance your outdoor kitchen experience, look no further.

With the Golden Hour Outdoor Kitchen Island, you'll add Urban Bonfire's highest-quality island frame and cabinetry, paired with a premium, bestselling built-in Blaze grill\\u2014all without the time and hassle of using a contractor. That's 4 modules in total with stylish, secure drawers and cabinets, plus an outdoor refrigerator and stainless steel sink for a complete cooking experience in one easy-to-assemble purchase.</p><p>Nothing says luxury like an island built around a Blaze LTE+ gas grill. Not to be outdone, this island's construction stands alone in the market, thanks to noncombustible, thick gauge marine grade aluminum with 304 stainless steel hardware and super durable NACRA\\u0112\\u2122 powder coated finish inside and out. Talk about the quality. The Golden Hour Outdoor Kitchen Island also features a premium Dekton\\u00ae countertop, with components including a top drawer, a trash and recycling drawer (with bins included), a single cabinet with under-sink access, and a double-door cabinet with under-grill access, in addition to an outdoor refrigerator and a stainless steel sink and faucet.</p><p><b>Dimensions:</b> 120 1/2 inches wide, 36 and 1/2 inches high, 29 and 3/4 inches deep.<em>Note: if your island isn't going to be against a wall, you will need back panels (available separately).</em></p><p><strong>Reward Your Inner Grill Master with the Blaze LTE+ 5-Burner Propane Grill </strong></p> <p>The 40-Inch Blaze LTE+ Propane Grill is the perfect addition to any outdoor kitchen, featuring commercial-grade stainless steel for extra durability to last a lifetime in any backyard. The double-lined hood keeps heat inside the grill where you need it most and prevents discoloration. The LTE+ model also includes a hood assist mechanism for easy opening plus interior and exterior lighting. White interior halogen lights illuminate the cooking area while the hood is open for easy visibility at night. The LED-illuminated control system features safety glow lighting which shines white when your lights are turned on and changes to red when your burners are lit, and gas is flowing through your grill. The removable warming rack is perfect for toasting and keeping food warm, and for added convenience, the full-width drip tray is removable for easy cleaning. </p> <p>Designed for effortless lighting, Blaze's push-and-turn flame-thrower ignition reliably lights your grill without issue every time. Five cast stainless steel burners generate 14,000 BTUs each for an impressive total of 70,000 BTUs across the grilling surface. Add to that the rear infrared burner's 10,000 BTUs and you've got a grill that can cook anything. Patented triangle-shaped cooking rods use the flat side to soak up heat from the burners and transfer it to the pointed top of the grate where your food sits to give it a nice sear. Beneath these cooking rods sit 14-gauge stainless steel, full-width flame tamers that help control flare-ups, evenly distribute heat, and eliminate cold spots for consistent temperatures throughout the grill. </p><p><strong>Keep Food and Drinks Cool with a 5.5 Cubic Foot Outdoor Rated Fridge </strong></p><p>The Blaze 24-Inch 5.5 Cubic Feet Outdoor Rated Compact Refrigerator is a perfect companion to any outdoor kitchen.  Keep food cold while your grill preheats without having to go inside and keep your favorite chilled beverages within easy reach. Constructed of long-lasting 304 stainless steel, it features a locking mechanism, 3 adjustable glass shelves, and white LED-lit cabinet for easy nighttime access, so you won't have to hunt for your drinks in the dark. A digital thermostat with a temperature display is also included for precise cooling control. The spacious interior can hold up to 152 cans, making it ideal for entertaining large crowds. The fridge is also ETL certified, meaning it is safe to use in outdoor environments.</p><p><strong>Simplify Prep and Cleanup with an Outdoor Sink </strong></p><p>The Urban Bonfire Stainless Steel Sink and Faucet is a convenient bonus for any outdoor kitchen island. Constructed of 304 stainless steel, this sink is crafted to withstand the elements of any backyard for long-lasting performance you can count on. It's plumbed with hot and cold water, and will also work fine with only cold water, making it versatile for cooking, cleaning, and more, from scrubbing veggies and cleaning counters to washing hands. The sink's large basin provides plenty of space to wash dishes, prep food, or fill pots with ease. The included faucet features an attractive, sleek design and is also made from durable stainless steel to complement any outdoor kitchen aesthetic. With Urban Bonfire's commitment to quality and functionality, this sink and faucet set enhances the practicality of your outdoor kitchen.</p><p><strong>Solid, Easy-to-Assemble Cabinet Modules are Marine-Grade Aluminum with a NACRA\\u0112 finish </strong></p><p>For cabinetry that will enhance your outdoor kitchen experience, look no further. Urban Bonfire modules are designed to withstand even the harshest outdoor conditions with marine-grade aluminum that has a NACRA\\u0112 powder-coated finish. NACRA\\u0112 is an antimicrobial product made from FDA-approved, environmentally sustainable materials and features a durable all-season formulation that resists fading, stains, and scratches.</p><p>These cabinets are as tough as they are functional. The outdoor rated 304 stainless steel hardware will last a lifetime, while the removable panels allow easy access to plumbing and electrical connections, making installation and maintenance a breeze. The commercial-grade stainless steel leveling legs and self-leveling toe kick adapt to slope and site conditions, ensuring a stable and secure installation on any surface. Each outdoor kitchen design includes drawers, a trash/recycling bin, and plenty of cabinet storage space to fit all your cooking tools and accessories. Their sleek design and practical features make these cabinets the perfect addition to any outdoor kitchen setup.</p><p><strong>The Blaze x Urban Bonfire Outdoor Kitchen Island is finished in Gunmetal</strong>, a warm taupe color that will match any outdoor kitchen style or d\\u00e9cor. Neutral tones are a great choice for your backyard as they will blend seamlessly with the surrounding natural environment and your current d\\u00e9cor. </p><p><strong>Easy-to-Maintain Premium Dekton Aeris Countertop for Prep and Staging </strong></p><p>You will impress guests with the elegance of an Aeris Premium Dekton countertop finish. Inspired by white limestone, Aeris features a cream-colored hue with subtle detailing that adds depth and character. This neutral shade works perfectly with any architectural style, offering flexibility in design choices. The light and airy tones of Aeris create a tranquil ambiance, making it an ideal choice. With its easy-to-maintain surface, Aeris combines aesthetic appeal with practical functionality, ensuring your outdoor kitchen is both beautiful and durable. Specially engineered packaging with easy, adhesive-free installation ensures a hassle-free setup.</p><p><strong>Urban Bonfire Care &amp; Maintenance Kit Included</strong></p><p>Included with all Blaze x Urban Bonfire outdoor kitchen islands, the Urban Bonfire Care &amp; Maintenance Kit is designed to keep your outdoor kitchen looking beautiful.

With the Golden Hour Outdoor Kitchen Island, you'll add Urban Bonfire's highest-quality island frame and cabinetry, paired with a premium, bestselling built-in Blaze grill\\u2014all without the time and hassle of using a contractor. That's 4 modules in total with stylish, secure drawers and cabinets, plus an outdoor refrigerator and stainless steel sink for a complete cooking experience in one easy-to-assemble purchase.</p><p>Nothing says luxury like an island built around a Blaze LTE+ gas grill. Not to be outdone, this island's construction stands alone in the market, thanks to noncombustible, thick gauge marine grade aluminum with 304 stainless steel hardware and super durable NACRA\\u0112\\u2122 powder coated finish inside and out. Talk about the quality. The Golden Hour Outdoor Kitchen Island also features a premium Dekton\\u00ae countertop, with components including a top drawer, a trash and recycling drawer (with bins included), a single cabinet with under-sink access, and a double-door cabinet with under-grill access, in addition to an outdoor refrigerator and a stainless steel sink and faucet.</p><p><b>Dimensions:</b> 120 1/2 inches wide, 36 and 1/2 inches high, 29 and 3/4 inches deep.<em>Note: if your island isn't going to be against a wall, you will need back panels (available separately).</em></p><p><strong>Reward Your Inner Grill Master with the Blaze LTE+ 5-Burner Natural Gas Grill </strong></p> <p>The 40-Inch Blaze LTE+ Natural Gas Grill is the perfect addition to any outdoor kitchen, featuring commercial-grade stainless steel for extra durability to last a lifetime in any backyard. The double-lined hood keeps heat inside the grill where you need it most and prevents discoloration. The LTE+ model also includes a hood assist mechanism for easy opening plus interior and exterior lighting. White interior halogen lights illuminate the cooking area while the hood is open for easy visibility at night. The LED-illuminated control system features safety glow lighting which shines white when your lights are turned on and changes to red when your burners are lit, and gas is flowing through your grill. The removable warming rack is perfect for toasting and keeping food warm, and for added convenience, the full-width drip tray is removable for easy cleaning. </p> <p>Designed for effortless lighting, Blaze's push-and-turn flame-thrower ignition reliably lights your grill without issue every time. Five cast stainless steel burners generate 14,000 BTUs each for an impressive total of 70,000 BTUs across the grilling surface. Add to that the rear infrared burner's 10,000 BTUs and you've got a grill that can cook anything. Patented triangle-shaped cooking rods use the flat side to soak up heat from the burners and transfer it to the pointed top of the grate where your food sits to give it a nice sear. Beneath these cooking rods sit 14-gauge stainless steel, full-width flame tamers that help control flare-ups, evenly distribute heat, and eliminate cold spots for consistent temperatures throughout the grill. </p><p><strong>Keep Food and Drinks Cool with a 5.5 Cubic Foot Outdoor Rated Fridge </strong></p><p>The Blaze 24-Inch 5.5 Cubic Feet Outdoor Rated Compact Refrigerator is a perfect companion to any outdoor kitchen.  Keep food cold while your grill preheats without having to go inside and keep your favorite chilled beverages within easy reach. Constructed of long-lasting 304 stainless steel, it features a locking mechanism, 3 adjustable glass shelves, and white LED-lit cabinet for easy nighttime access, so you won't have to hunt for your drinks in the dark. A digital thermostat with a temperature display is also included for precise cooling control. The spacious interior can hold up to 152 cans, making it ideal for entertaining large crowds. The fridge is also ETL certified, meaning it is safe to use in outdoor environments.</p><p><strong>Simplify Prep and Cleanup with an Outdoor Sink </strong></p><p>The Urban Bonfire Stainless Steel Sink and Faucet is a convenient bonus for any outdoor kitchen island. Constructed of 304 stainless steel, this sink is crafted to withstand the elements of any backyard for long-lasting performance you can count on. It's plumbed with hot and cold water, and will also work fine with only cold water, making it versatile for cooking, cleaning, and more, from scrubbing veggies and cleaning counters to washing hands. The sink's large basin provides plenty of space to wash dishes, prep food, or fill pots with ease. The included faucet features an attractive, sleek design and is also made from durable stainless steel to complement any outdoor kitchen aesthetic. With Urban Bonfire's commitment to quality and functionality, this sink and faucet set enhances the practicality of your outdoor kitchen.</p><p><strong>Solid, Easy-to-Assemble Cabinet Modules are Marine-Grade Aluminum with a NACRA\\u0112 finish </strong></p><p>For cabinetry that will enhance your outdoor kitchen experience, look no further. Urban Bonfire modules are designed to withstand even the harshest outdoor conditions with marine-grade aluminum that has a NACRA\\u0112 powder-coated finish. NACRA\\u0112 is an antimicrobial product made from FDA-approved, environmentally sustainable materials and features a durable all-season formulation that resists fading, stains, and scratches.</p><p>These cabinets are as tough as they are functional. The outdoor rated 304 stainless steel hardware will last a lifetime, while the removable panels allow easy access to plumbing and electrical connections, making installation and maintenance a breeze. The commercial-grade stainless steel leveling legs and self-leveling toe kick adapt to slope and site conditions, ensuring a stable and secure installation on any surface. Each outdoor kitchen design includes drawers, a trash/recycling bin, and plenty of cabinet storage space to fit all your cooking tools and accessories. Their sleek design and practical features make these cabinets the perfect addition to any outdoor kitchen setup.</p><p><strong>The Blaze x Urban Bonfire Outdoor Kitchen Island is finished in Gunmetal</strong>, a warm taupe color that will match any outdoor kitchen style or d\\u00e9cor. Neutral tones are a great choice for your backyard as they will blend seamlessly with the surrounding natural environment and your current d\\u00e9cor. </p><p><strong>Easy-to-Maintain Premium Dekton Keon Countertop for Prep and Staging </strong></p> <p>The Blaze outdoor kitchen island is topped with the sleek sophistication of a Keon Premium Dekton countertop. Designed to look like the natural beauty of real stone without imperfections, Keon offers a light and bright gray tone that adds a touch of modern elegance to any space. Its non-porous surface ensures easy cleaning and maintenance, making it a practical choice for outdoor kitchens.
